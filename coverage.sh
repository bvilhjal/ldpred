# Script for running code coverage of ldpred tests.
#
# For this script to work, the coverage tool must have previously been installed
# via `pip install coverage` .
#
# Coverage files will be stored in subdirectories under ${TMPDIR}/ldpred or, if
# TMPDIR is not defined, /tmp/ldpred.
#
# By default, all tests are run.  However, any arguments passed to coverage.sh
# will be forwarded to the `coverage` tool.  See below for an example on how to
# run a specific test.
#
# Examples
# --------
# Run coverage on all tests, using default tmp dir.  This will create /tmp/ldpred/.
# $ ./coverage.sh
#
# Run coverage on all tests , using specified tmp dir.  This will create ${HOME}/tmp/ldpred.
# $ TMPDIR=${HOME}/tmp ./coverage.sh
#
# Run coverage for a specific test.
# $ ./coverage.sh -m unittest test.TestLDpred.test_ldpred_inf

# Check first if the coverage tool is available.
